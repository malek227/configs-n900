# /etc/default/iphbd
# This is a configuration file for /etc/init.d/iphbd; it allows you to
# perform common modifications to the behavior of the iphb daemon
# startup without editing the init script
#
export IPHBD_DAEMON_OPTS=""
#  -d enables debug mode, can be toggled with sending SIGUSR1 to iphbd
#  -a enables simple mode (where all clients are ALWAYS waken up at the same time)
#  -k disables TCP keepalive queuing
#  -w does not wake from kernel signal
#  NN interval is the heartbeat in seconds (default 30), minumum is 3 secs
#     (value 0 is to run iphbd in a 'dummy' mode that does not sync clients;
#      this can be used for power measurements)
